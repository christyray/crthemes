Description: A personal theme to use with ggplot2 for making visualizations for
    my thesis project. It is designed to simplify the process of creating
    publication-quality figures. It includes theme functions for scatter plots,
    bar graphs, and heat maps, and it also includes default color palettes and
    fonts to use with the theme functions.
